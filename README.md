<h1> GameSpace - a game to change the future </h1>
<br> 
I made this game at a national GameDev hackathon. Although I did not win, I received a lot of experience and understood that I am able to make projects by my own. 
<br> 
GameSpace is a labyrinth game, where main hero (austronaut) should go through space trash and not to be killed by aliens. The tecnique of the game is similar to wide-known PacMan, but the idea beneath this game is deeper. By playing this game people start to think about all the garbage up there in space which raises awareness about the issue. 
<br>
In this project I worked individually and I was responsible for the main idea of the game, its design, design of characters, animation, sound effects. Although I had only 2 days, I managed to program a working game. Sure, there are lots of different setbacks that need careful consideration and code refinement, however the main functions work properly.

To build the game I used pygame, a module of python, which enables to create 2D mini-games using python. I chose this module because by that time I knew it the best.
